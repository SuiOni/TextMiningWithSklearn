Although the policies of Wikipedia strongly espouse verifiability and a neutral point of view, critics of Wikipedia accuse it of systemic bias and inconsistencies (including undue weight given to popular culture),[15] and allege that it favors consensus over credentials in its editorial processes.[16] Its reliability and accuracy are also targeted.[17] Other criticisms center on its susceptibility to vandalism and the addition of spurious or unverified information;[18] however, scholarly work suggests that vandalism is generally short-lived.[19][20] An investigation in Nature found that the science articles they compared came close to the level of accuracy of Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and had a similar rate of "serious errors."[21]
