Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in a perceived English-centric Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[33] Later that year, Wales announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and its website was moved to wikipedia.org.[34] Various other wiki-encyclopedia projects have been started, largely under a different philosophy from the open and NPOV editorial model of Wikipedia. Wikinfo does not require a neutral point of view and allows original research. New Wikipedia-inspired projects – such as Citizendium, Scholarpedia, Conservapedia, and Google's Knol where the articles are a little more essayistic[35] – have been started to address perceived limitations of Wikipedia, such as its policies on peer review, original research, and commercial advertising.
