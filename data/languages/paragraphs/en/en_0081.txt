Wikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,[217] often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for plagiarizing from Wikipedia.[218][219][220] In July 2007, Wikipedia was the focus of a 30-minute documentary on BBC Radio 4[221] which argued that, with increased usage and awareness, the number of references to Wikipedia in popular culture is such that the term is one of a select band of 21st-century nouns that are so familiar (Google, Facebook, YouTube) that they no longer need explanation and are on a par with such 20th-century terms as Hoovering or Coca-Cola.
