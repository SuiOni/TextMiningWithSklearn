The Wikipedia community has established "a bureaucracy of sorts", including "a clear power structure that gives volunteer administrators the authority to exercise editorial control."[143][144][145] Wikipedia's community has also been described as "cult-like,"[146] although not always with entirely negative connotations,[147] and criticized for failing to accommodate inexperienced users.[148] Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship; this begins with "administrator,"[149][150] a group of privileged users who have the ability to delete pages, lock articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes, and block users from editing. Despite the name, administrators do not enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead they are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to block users making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).[151][152]
