Wikipedia has been accused of exhibiting systemic bias and inconsistency;[17] additionally, critics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for much of the information makes it unreliable.[114] Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia is generally reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not always clear.[16] Editors of traditional reference works such as the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica have questioned the project's utility and status as an encyclopedia.[115] Many university lecturers discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in academic work, preferring primary sources;[116] some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.[117] Co-founder Jimmy Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate as primary sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.[118]
