In addition to logistic growth in the number of its articles,[201] Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.[202] According to Alexa and comScore, Wikipedia is among the ten most visited websites worldwide.[7][203] The growth of Wikipedia has been fueled by its dominant position in Google search results;[204] about 50% of search engine traffic to Wikipedia comes from Google,[205] a good portion of which is related to academic research.[206] The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.[9] The Pew Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.[207] In October 2006, the site was estimated to have a hypothetical market value of $580Â million if it ran advertisements.[208]
