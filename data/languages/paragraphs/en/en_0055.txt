As the New York Times reports concerning a Wikipedia survey conducted and analyzed 2009-2010 in the wake of Wikipedia's 10th anniversary, "Wikimedia Foundation...collaborated on a study of Wikipediaâ€™s contributor base and discovered that it was barely 13 percent women; the average age of a contributor was in the mid-20s, according to the study by a joint center of the United Nations University and Maastricht University" and also notes that "surveys suggest that less than 15 percent of its hundreds of thousands of contributors are women." A goal set by Sue Gardner, Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director, is to see female editing contributions increase to 25 percent by 2015.[134]Linda Basch, President of the National Council for Research on Women notes the contrast in these Wikipedia editors' statistics with the majority percentage which women are currently filling in enrollment in BA, Masters and PhD programs in nations such as the US.[135]
