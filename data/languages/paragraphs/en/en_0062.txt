In a 2003 study of Wikipedia as a community, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in wiki software create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that a "creative construction" approach encourages participation.[156] In his 2008 book, The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It, Jonathan Zittrain of the Oxford Internet Institute and Harvard Law Schoolâ€™s Berkman Center for Internet & Society cites Wikipedia's success as a case study in how open collaboration has fostered innovation on the web.[157] A 2008 study found that Wikipedia users were less agreeable and open, though more conscientious, than non-Wikipedia users.[158][159] A 2009 study suggested there was "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content."[160]
